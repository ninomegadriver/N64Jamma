The N64Jamma emulates two gamepads mapped to a standard Jamma edge connector. Buttons are mapped to be suitable for games such as Killer Instinct Gold and Mortal Kombat Trilogy. Using two onboard dip switches or borne terminal connectors, the directional pad can be configured as digital or analog, making possible to play all sorts of games. Furthermore, by selecting "Encoder" via dip switch, the Jamma inputs Up/Down and Left/Right can be attached to Rotary Encoders, making it possible to play racing games.  
  
The "kick buttons" are mapped to the Jamma edge as like the Pandora's Box configuration, but also on a single male terminal pins in the classic Street Fighter bootleg standard. The remaining buttons Z, L and R are also available on the side borne connectors.  
 
The board also features a small PAM8406 module slot for audio amplification. Furthermore, there's a CGA-standard DB9 connector for easy integration with RGB modded Nintendo 64.  
  
The Atmega328p MCUs code are based on the [At64 code](https://github.com/ninomegadriver/At64). The [binary files](https://github.com/ninomegadriver/N64Jamma/blob/main/N64Jamma-Atmega328p.bin) and [fuse configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ninomegadriver/N64Jamma/main/N64Jamma-Atmega328p-FUSE.png) are also available.
